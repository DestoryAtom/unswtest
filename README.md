# UNSW TEST
This repo is built for every MIT student to test your program or database with more test cases or contribute your test cases for other students.
This repo will only accept test cases and expected outputs. **No ANSWERS PLEASE!**

Welcome everyone to fork and pull request for this repo.
I really hope anyone who is experienced with test or program can join the project and provide some test cases and outputs for each quiz or assignment.

If you are interested or have any suggestion please feel free to contact me through wechat:`shuofeng` or email:`yangshuo225@gmail.com`
